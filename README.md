## What is SchoolHub?

SchoolHub is a platform that is meant to digitize the school system in Romania. It is a platform that
connects students, teachers, and parents in a single place and that is easy to use and accessible to everyone.

## Why SchoolHub?

The school system in Romania is outdated and it is not efficient. We want to change that. We want to make the school system
in Romania more efficient and more accessible to everyone that owns a smartphone or a computer. With that purpose in mind,
we have created SchoolHub, that provides a set of tools that can ease the communication between students, teachers, and parents,
but also provide a set of tools that can ease the teaching process for teachers and make the learning process for students
more interactive.

## What is the purpose of this repository?
